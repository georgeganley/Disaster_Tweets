# Disaster Tweets Prediction with BERT

This notebook originally comes from the Kaggle's "KerasNLP Starter Notebook Disaster Tweets". The original version uses Keras' DistilBERT pretrained model to identify tweets that are about or describe true disasters.

The original notebook has been edited to use Hugging Face's transform library and pyTorch to solve for the same issue.
